  “It’s good that the kids care about us” - Rosco
</div>

<br>

<div class="text_box">
Last night 40 patrons at a street kitchen in Darlinghurst enjoyed the delicious meals made by the 5 families who attended our Cook4Good program yesterday afternoon. More meals will be distributed Monday night to patrons at Central through Will2live. In a world that is changing fast and where fear can overtake us, it is inspiring to work together to make an impact. As “Rosco”, wearing one of our “Warm4Winter” beanies and unloading the boot of our car said: “ I like your people, it is good the kids care about us and lucky for us they are good cooks. Please tell them thank you from us all.”So a big thankyou to all our Cook4Good families! Our next program day is Sunday 16 August and there are 2 more in September. We are Covid safe so please bring masks, numbers are limited to 20 people (generally max 8 family groups)! Stay safe x
